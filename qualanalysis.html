    <h2>Qualitative Analysis Report</h2>
    <img src="images/qual-analysis-mini.png" alt="a snippet of the qualitative analysis report">
  <p>One of the main goals of any university degree program is producing employable graduates. 
      This qualitative analysis surveys the available job market at the time for positions that 
      I might seek to apply for (entry-level technical writing positions in technologically 
      related fields), with the intent to discover (a) the work available, (b) skills required 
      and expected, and (c) required and preferred qualifications. The document offers a literature 
      review, detailed methods of data collection, a breakdown of results with visual data organizers, 
      and a discussion of what the analysis means for a Master's student halfway through a degree in 
      Technical Communication and Rhetoric. While this project is highly tailored toward my own personal 
      career interests and academic experience, it serves to convey and explain complex information.</p>
  <p>This report is directed toward the professor instructing the course, though it may also be helpful 
      for a graduate advisor or fellow graduate students of the Technical Communication and Rhetoric 
      program interested in the same niche of the field. The topic is self-selected for my own learning purposes.</p>
  <p>This project originated as a self-proposed assignment for the course Foundations in Technical Communication.</p>
