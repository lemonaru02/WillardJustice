    <h2>Rhetorical Analysis of <em>Brat</em> Songs</h2>
    <img src="images/rhet-analysis-mini.png" alt="a snippet of the rhetorical analysis poster">
  <p>Ancient rhetorical theory can often get lost in translation when it comes to contemporary pop culture, 
      but those theories are still very present in our everyday lives. This rhetorical analysis considers 
      the feminist rhetoric within the remixes of two songs from CharliXCX's 2024 album <em>Brat and it's completely 
      different but also still brat</em>, grounded in the theories of rhetorician Desiderius Erasmus. The analysis 
      considers the conceptual, interactive, and technical aspects of a remix as rhetorical elements which develop 
      each song's deeper meaning. Ultimately, the discussion claims that these remixes are evidence of the power of 
      rhetoric to affect an international, cross-class, and cross-genre audience.</p>
  <p>The original essay is intended for an in-depth academic discussion of the topic for a scholar of rhetoric. That 
      discussion is translated into a brief ten-minute poster presentation for fellow graduate students outside the 
      field of rhetoric studies. It is also translated into a twenty-minute conference presentation for the 2025 
      Creative Women's Writing Association conference, an audience composed of feminist writers and scholars across a 
      variety of fields.</p>
  <p>This project originated as an assignment for the course Theories of Invention in Writing.</p>
