  <h2>Hello!</h2>
  <p>My name is Willard Justice, and I am currently a second-year Masters student in the <a href="https://www.depts.ttu.edu/english/programs_degrees/ma/tc/index.php">Texas Tech program of Technical Communication and Rhetoric</a>. I have a Bachelor of Arts from <a href="https://acu.edu/academics/undergraduate/bachelor-of-arts-in-english/">Abilene Christian University in English</a>, with a minor in Spanish.</p>
  <p>My research interests emphasize tactical technical communication of information through unofficial modalities, which particularly involves an understanding of rhetoric within music as well as composition of user-facing informational documents such as manuals and training materials. I also enjoy working with STEM-related materials, and after graduation, I plan to enter the industry of technical writing full-time for a company centered around engineering or medicine.</p>
  <p>I am currently practicing my technical writing skills through my role as a graduate part-time instructor (GPTI) of the first-year writing (FYW) program at Texas Tech. I have instructed in a face-to-face classroom setting as well as asynchronously online. By engaging with my students in person, online, and through course materials, I am developing a stronger understanding of user experience in response to standardized and individualized informational documents. It is my goal to bring this skill into my future professional career by composing and presenting more effective and supportive user-facing documents.</p>
  <p>Between classes and teaching, I spend my free time flexing my creativity and honing my eye for detail through various fiber arts such as crochet, cross-stitch, and sewing. I pride myself on my joyful personality, a strong sense of justice, and a pedagogy of kindness. I look forward to each new opportunity that I may come into in the future!</p>
