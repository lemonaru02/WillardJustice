    <h2>Technical Communication of Surgery Technique</h2>
    <img src="images/Stock-Project1.png" alt="">
  <p>Surgery is often a confusing and anxiety-inducing event for patients, and better 
      communication between a patient and their doctors can help to ease those issues. 
      The adaptive one-page brochure aims to both offer information on this recently-developed 
      technique for preserving chest sensation and space to record conversation. This balance 
      between standardized and flexible allows each patient to get the same necessary information, 
      ask questions and remember the answers, and develop a personalized procedure plan with 
      their consulting surgeon.</p>
      <p>The brochure is written primarily for transgender patients, as well as other patients 
          considering the surgery, consulting surgeons, and family medicine practitioners who 
          may recommend the surgery. The project report is for a hypothetical client, a medical 
          facility which often discusses surgeries such as this one.</p>
      <p>This project originated as an assignment for the course Rhetoric of Scientific Literature.</p>
